            <h2>
                About the Author: Eric Carle
            </h2>
            <p>
                The very hungry caterpillar was written by Eric Carle, but who was he? Eric Carle was born on
                June 25th of 1929 in New York (U.S.A). When he was 6 years old he moved with his family to Germany
                where his mother was from and later, in 1952 he moved back again and started working as a graphic
                designer at The New York Times. When author Bill Martin Jr. saw one of his illustrations Carle had 
                made, he asked him to collaborate on a book called Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? which was
                published in 1967 and became a bestseller. After this Carle started writing and illustrating his own
                books. Soon after he published The Very Hungry Caterpillar in 1969 which became a massive success with
                more than 50 million copies being sold. <br><br>

                Eric Carle became famous for the unique and innovative style of his artworks. He used collage techniques 
                to create his artworks. He layered hand-painted papers which gave it the iconic bright and cheerful looks.
                Sometimes he also added extra dimensions in his works. In The Very Hungry Caterpillar he added holes in the 
                pages to represent what the caterpillar ate. In some he added twinkling lights or sounds of insects.<br><br>

                The themes of the books were usually inspired by nature. Eric Carle attempted to bridge the gap between
                schools and home and many of his stories were inspired by walks he would take with his father through
                the woods where he would see all kinds of nature. Using these themes in his books, he attempted to help
                children learn and spark their curiosity.
