            Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here's the story of a little caterpillar that hatches from an egg. Right from the start from the day he was
            born,
            he is always hungry and starts eating different foods each day. However, in order to lessen his appetite, he
            ate
            lots of junk food. His overeating lead to feeling overly stuffed. A wise choice of a leaf the next day
            brings relief,
            and as time passes, the caterpillar grows up. The following days he built himself a cocoon, and he emerged as
            a
            stunning butterfly!

        <h2>
            Origin of the story
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is told that <a href="./author.html">Eric Carle</a> was inspired for this idea when he was punching some
            holes on some document papers.
            He came up with the following idea: a Bookwork character based on what he just did. A while later, he came
            with
            the idea to make it about a caterpillar. Immediately, he knew how he would design the book itself: the book
            had
            to have cut-out pages that all differed. He gained this idea from some books that he had read during his
            childhood,
            which he really enjoyed.

            The book was published by the World Publishing Company in 1969. Later, Penguin Random House became the
            bookâ€™s publisher.
            The book has been translated more than 60 languages speaking of its worldwide popularity.

        <h2>
            Lesson behind the story
        </h2>
        <p>
            Although the book is very short, it has a lot of lessons for children in it. First of all, it introduces
            toddlers to all
            kinds of food, and it teaches them what feeling very hungry is.
            When children get older, they can recognise the patterns in the book, namely that the amount of food that
            the caterpillar
            eats increases and increases and that a high amount of food is not good for you.
            Moreover, kids can also learn the names of days of the week by reading this book. Another lesson kids can
            learn from
            this book is the life cycle of a caterpillar and how it evolves into a beautiful butterfly
        </p>

    <section id="story__effect">
        <h2>
            Effect on children's life
        </h2>
        <p>
            Once children understand the story of the Very Hungry Caterpillar, they will notice the eating pattern of
            the caterpillar.
            They will know that overeating and eating too much unhealthy food makes the caterpillar sick. Children can
            be more aware
            of the food choices they make in the future, because they now know that junk food is not good for you.
