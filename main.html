                        Eric Carle (June 25, 1929 – May 23, 2021) was an acclaimed American author, designer, and
                        illustrator of children's books. Born in Syracuse, New York, Carle moved to Germany with his
                        parents when he was six years old¹. He was educated there and graduated from the prestigious art
                        school, the Akademie der bildenden Künste, in Stuttgart. Despite the challenges of living in
                        Germany during World War II, Carle nurtured his dream of returning to America.
                        <br><br>
                        His career took a turn when respected educator and author, Bill Martin Jr, noticed a striking
                        picture of a red lobster that Carle had created for an advertisement. This led to their
                        collaboration on the book "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?", which became a favorite
                        with children everywhere.
                        <br><br>
                        Carle's best-known work, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar", has been translated into 66 languages
                        and sold over 50 million copies. His distinctive artwork, created in collage technique using
                        hand-painted papers, is instantly recognizable. Many of his books have an added
                        dimension—die-cut pages, twinkling lights, even the lifelike sound of a cricket’s song, giving
                        them a playful quality. His intuitive understanding of and respect for children, coupled with
                        his love of nature and his innovative art, made his books beloved by children all over the
                        world.
